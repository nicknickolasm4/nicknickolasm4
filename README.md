## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer and freelancer since 2015, currently pursuing a degree in Science and Technology at the Federal University of Alfenas (UNIFAL) in Poços de Caldas - MG, Brazil.

My journey into programming began at the age of 8 when I received my first computer. Initially, I faced academic challenges, but this gift sparked my curiosity about technology. I started by exploring HTML and PHP, eventually delving into game modding and learning C++ to create plugins and open-source projects. This hands-on experience laid the foundation for my career in software development.

Over the years, I've transitioned from hobbyist projects to professional freelance work, continuously expanding my skill set and embracing new technologies.
